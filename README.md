In this study, researchers observed depleted levels of ATP, indicating altered mitochondrial functioning, which is significant as previous studies link such changes to neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. They found that baseline cortisol levels were associated with ATP levels, with lower cortisol levels correlating with higher ATP levels at baseline. This aligns with previous findings suggesting that cortisol stimulates processes that consume ATP. However, after sleep deprivation, this relationship between cortisol and ATP levels disappeared. Morning cortisol levels, which are typically higher, were significantly lower after sleep deprivation, possibly due to increased negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This regulation might also explain the lack of correlation between cortisol and ATP levels after sleep deprivation. We decided to solely focus on cortisol levels and how sleep deprivation leads to changes in initial spikes in cortisol levels.
